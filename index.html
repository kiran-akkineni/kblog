<p>When comparing trends in large chunks of data, it’s easy to arrive at the wrong conclusions
  when you don’t understand the underlying data in full context. When a segment makes
  up a bigger piece of the pie in one group vs. another, that segment can over-influence
  the aggregate results. If you are unaware of this over-influence, you could make
  the wrong decision for your business.</p>
<h1 id="The-example">

<p>Let’s say you are deciding on two types of advertising for a nationwide promotion
  coming up. To aid in your decision, you run each ad in test city and monitor performance
  for 5 days. </p>
<p>After the 5 days are over, you put together a basic data table by day and by city,
  to compare conversion rates:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Day</th>
      <th>City A visits</th>
      <th>City A conversion</th>
      <th>City B visits</th>
      <th>City B conversion</th>
      <th>City A vs City B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<p>You notice that when you compare the totals for each city, that city A has a 1.5%
  lower conversion rate than city B, but when you review the performance by day,
  city A wins by 5.3% every single day. So which city had the better results and
  which ad should you choose?</p>
<h1 id="The-math">
  <a href="#The-math" class="headerlink" title="The math"></a>The math</h1>
<p>If you look at the visits by day, you can see that on day 3, city A had 200 visits,
  which represents 42% of the total visits for city A in the 5 days. City B had 150
  visits on that day, which represents 31% of the total visits. So even though both
  cities had much lower conversion than normal on day 3, and city A had a 5.3% higher
  conversion that city B, the impact of that bad day on city A’s totals was much
  higher than on city B’s totals because the bad day was over-represented in city
  A relative to city B.</p>
<p>If you had chosen the ad that ran in city B because of the overall better performance,
  you potentially would have given up the 5.3% additional orders you would have gained
  had you chosen city A.</p>

<p>Make sure to dig a bit deeper and review your data across a few different (and relevant)
  segments, to ensure there aren’t inherent biases in the data driven by differences
  in mix. It can make a substantial difference in your outcomes and prevent big surprises
  down the line.</p>

<p>The payback interval is the amount of time it takes to break even on a given marketing
  investment. When managing cash in a startup or other early-stage business, the
  time value of money plays an especially important role, given the level of operating
  risk under which most young businesses operate. This can be especially true with
  regards to paid marketing. The faster that the money you spend turns into new customers
  and new orders, the faster you can redeploy that money into more marketing and
  thus more growth. Marketing spend that takes less time to pay back the initial
  investment can have a significant positive effect on the business, even though
  the total return may be lower per investment.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s January, and you are deciding between spending $1000 on search advertising
  or social network advertising, for a business with 50% profit margin per order.

<p>As you can see, you got $2100 back in Social ($1100 net of $1000 investment) after
  a year and only $1600 ($600 net) in Search, a difference of 31% (83%). But you
  achieved profitability in Search by March and in Social by July, less than half
  the time.</p>
<h1 id="The-math">
  <a href="#The-math" class="headerlink" title="The math"></a>The math</h1>
<p>Let’s put together a table of cumulative profit for each ad type, net of the $1000
  initial investment. Let’s also add some columns for reinvested $1000 investments,
  that you can only make when you get your initial $1000 back from the prior investment.</p>
<p>Here is the cumulative profit table for Search:
  <br>| Month | 1st investment | 2nd investment | 3rd investment | 4th investment | 5th
  investment | 6th investment |
  <br>|——-|—————-|—————-|—————-|—————-|—————-|—————-|

  <br>| Dec | 600 | 500 | 400 | 300 | 100 | -200 |</p>
<p>Here is the cumulative profit table for Social:
  <br>| Month | 1st investment | 2nd investment |
  <br>|——-|—————-|—————-|
  <br>| Jan | -950 | |
  <br>| Feb | -900 | |
  <br>| Mar | -800 | |
  <br>| Apr | -700 | |
  <br>| May | -500 | |
  <br>| Jun | -300 | |
  <br>| Jul | 100 | -950 |
  <br>| Aug | 600 | -900 |
  <br>| Sep | 900 | -800 |

  <br>| Nov | 1050 | -500 |
  <br>| Dec | 1100 | -300 |</p>
<p>As you can see, because the payback interval for Search is so much faster than the
  interval for Social, you are able to reinvest so many more times (6 vs. 2 over
  the course of a year). As a result, the cumulative return by December for Search
  is more than double that of Social ($1700 vs. $800), despite Social’s superior
  cumulative return per investment ($1100 vs. $600).</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion">
  <a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Shorter payback intervals allow you to grow your business at an accelerated rate
  relative to longer intervals. The earlier the business is in its life cycle, the
  more impactful the acceleration. For mature businesses with cash reserves, there
  is some benefit to diversifying into greater returns, but for most young businesses,
  payback is key.</p>

<p>When a key metric changes, there’s often a clear driver that impacted all users or
  customers. Your checkout process is broken, you launched a special sale, you kicked
  off a loyalty program, and so on. But sometimes there isn’t an obvious reason,
  and and a deeper understanding of underlying marketing channels (or other user
  segments) is required. This allows you to determine whether the cause is missed
  performance in a given segment, or a change in size of a segment relative to other
  segments. The latter example is mix shift, and it can meaningfully impact if it
  persists.</p>
<h1 id="The-example">

<p>Let’s say your conversion rate in the latest week dropped from 5.05% the week before
  to 4.90%, and you want to know what caused the drop. You decide to start looking
  at the behavior of traffic coming through each of your 3 marketing channels. </p>
<p>So you put together a basic data table with traffic and conversion by each channel,
  and the totals:</p>

<p>The formulas used to calculate each field are right below each column header in the

<ul>
  <li>Translate ‘visits’ to ‘share’, in order to make traffic apples-to-apples from one
    week to the next</li>
  <li>Calculate ‘change in share’ to understand how each channel changed in size relative
    to other channels</li>
  <li>Calculate the ‘Last week conversion diff from avg.’ to understand whether a channel

<ul>
  <li>Intra-channel represents the portion of the change in conversion due to changes
    within a channel. In this case, Email generated a positive effect of 0.1% because
    its conversion increased from 6% to 6.2%</li>
  <li>Mix shift represents the portion of the change due to changes in the relative size
    of a channel. In this case, Search generated a negative effect of -0.19% because
    its share increased from 15% to 21% of the total traffic.</li>
  <li>Interaction represents a second order effect caused by a combination of mix and
    intra-channel. It’s the least actionable effect, but it’s also usually much smaller
    than the other effects</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many effects taking place that impacted the drop in conversion
  0.15 percentage points down to 4.90%, but the Search channel Mix effect stands
  out as the largest. Search, which has a much lower conversion than other channels,
  increased meaningfully from 15% to 21%. If this channel remains elevated, you’ll
  need to ensure that the underlying assumptions and economics account for this change
  lest it hurts overall profitability.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion">
  <a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Depending on how you look at it, mix shift can explain the large majority of changes
  in key metrics. Even special sales and loyalty programs represents segments that
  change the overall numbers when increasing or decreasing in size. Locating the
  mix shift and understanding why it happened is key to ensuring that your numbers
  don’t run askew and that your business stays healthy in the long run.</p>

<p>Digital marketing generally will create more sales, especially given the distribution
  capabilities of today’s leading ad platforms, but marketing spend is rarely frictionless.
  The cost to acquire more of a given population increases faster than sales because
  the quality of the additional traffic tends to decline, but this doesn’t necessarily
  mean you should stop spending. </p>
<h1 id="Simple-example">
  <a href="#Simple-example" class="headerlink" title="Simple example"></a>Simple example</h1>
<p>Say that you run a company that sells widgets, with a product margin of $10 per widget.
  You have recently been spending money on an ad platform called Poople, obtaining
  new widget orders at a cost of $5 per order. You are acquiring about 1000 orders
  per month through Poople, and now have the opportunity to increase your spend to
  acquire 1100 orders per month. To do this, you have calculated that your cost will
  now come out to $6 per order. Do you spend the money and increase sales at the
  increased cost?</p>
<h1 id="Framing-the-problem">
  <a href="#Framing-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="Framing the problem"></a>Framing the problem</h1>
<p>It helps to think of this decision in terms of marginal costs and profit. As far
  as you know, every additional widget sold will earn you $10, so your marginal profit
  is flat. You’ve now calculated that your additional cost per acquired order on
  Poople will increase from $5 to $6. So the question is whether the additional cost
  of the additional orders is lower than the additional margins from those additional
  orders (which you already know is $10).</p>
<h1 id="The-math">
  <a href="#The-math" class="headerlink" title="The math"></a>The math</h1>
<p>Once you’ve framed the problem, the math is fairly straightforward:</p>
<p>Marginal product margin = $10 / widget order
  <br>Marginal cost from marketing spend increase
  <br> = ($6 x 1100 - $5 x 1000)/(1100-1000)
  <br> = ($6600-$5000)/(1100-1000)
  <br> = ($1600)/(100)
  <br> = $16 / widget order</p>
<p>In this case, the marginal cost is higher than the marginal product margin. So each
  additional order is actually unprofitable, and it’s not worth the growth unless
  you are getting $6 worth of additional value from those orders outside of what
  the customers are paying.</p>
<p>Let’s say you would have been able to achieve 1200 orders after the added spend instead
  of 1100. In this case the marginal cost ends up being $8, meaning you’d continue
  making money on the additional widgets. At $8, the profit is less per widget than
  you make on the baseline 1000 orders, but it’s still a positive return, which makes
  the growth worth it.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion">
  <a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Make sure to understand and pay attention to marginal costs (and marginal gains)
  when deciding whether to increase marketing spend. Also, different ad platforms
  have different pricing models (CPC, CPM, etc.), so make sure to have the data to
  effectively translate that pricing into marginal costs. </p>

        <h1 id="CAC-defined">
  <a href="#CAC-defined" class="headerlink" title="CAC defined"></a>CAC defined</h1>
<p>Customer acquisition cost represents how many marketing dollars it costs to get customers
  to buy your product for the first time. The basic CAC calculation is [Total Marketing
  Spend]/[Total New Customers].</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-it-useful">
  <a href="#Why-is-it-useful" class="headerlink" title="Why is it useful?"></a>Why is it useful?</h1>
<p>The lower your CAC is relative to the total amount a customer spends with you over
  their lifetime (LTV), the better. It means you can potentially increase marketing
  spend in order to grow and scale your business. If your CAC is relatively high,
  it likely means you need more optimization around your marketing or that your business
  needs to depend more heavily on organic marketing (word of mouth, social, SEO)</p>
<h1 id="Diving-deeper">
  <a href="#Diving-deeper" class="headerlink" title="Diving deeper"></a>Diving deeper</h1>
<p>Given that CAC is a cost, it’s especially important to understand it in more detail.
  It’s easy to waste marketing dollars, especially in digital marketing, where more
  spend almost always seems to mean more customers.
  <br>Some additional analysis worth knowing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAC by marketing channel</li>
  <li>Components comprising CAC (cost of traffic, conversion rate, new customer %)</li>
  <li>CAC of the marginal or incremental customer if you increase marketing spend</li>
  <li>Impact of the sales cycle on CAC (it can go down over time with long sales cycles)</li>
  <li>Percentage of marketing spend that is driving repeat customers</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Conclusion">
  <a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>For any company that expands through paid marketing channels, it’s imperative to
  understand CAC and how it evolves as those channels mature over the business’ lifecycle.</p>
<p>If you are planning on raising capital for your business, make sure to know it across
  all meaningful dimensions. Most investors will assume some portion of the raised
  funds (especially mid-to-late stages) will be dedicated to marketing. They’ll want
  to know the funds will be deployed prudently, and knowing CAC is a basic requirement
  for that.</p>

  <a href="#AOV-defined" class="headerlink" title="AOV defined"></a>AOV defined</h1>
<p>Average order value is intended to represent the dollar amount of your average customer’s
  payment. At its simplest, AOV is represented as [Total Sales] / [Total Orders].
  So if you made $1000 in total sales in a month on 100 orders, your AOV would be
  $10 for that month.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-it-useful">
  <a href="#Why-is-it-useful" class="headerlink" title="Why is it useful?"></a>Why is it useful?</h1>
<p>AOV can be useful for a variety of reasons, a few of which are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding what your typical customer expects to spend with your business, which
    informs:
    <ul>
      <li>Insight into whether your pricing is appropriates</li>
      <li>Understand how customers from different channels differ in their spending habits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calculate the profit you make per order, which in turn informs:
    <ul>
      <li>How much you should be willing to pay to acquire an order through marketing</li>
      <li>How much you can offer in discounts without being unprofitable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Diving-deeper">
  <a href="#Diving-deeper" class="headerlink" title="Diving deeper"></a>Diving deeper</h1>
<p>After getting comfortable with the basics, there is a ton of additional analysis
  that you can perform on AOV in order to better understand your customers and your
  business.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Different components of AOV (product price and quantity, shipping costs, taxes)</li>
  <li>Changes in AOV (effects of seasonality, product mix, pricing, loyalty programs)</li>
  <li>Relationship between AOV and conversion rates (usually caused by pricing, but not
    exclusivelys)</li>
  <li>Behavioral differences between high-AOV customers and low-AOV customers</li>
  <li>Comparing AOV to Median Order Value, to understand how much AOV is skewed by high
    (or low) spending customers</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Conclusion">
  <a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>AOV is a fairly important metric, especially in early-stage ecommerce businesses.
  Investors will almost always ask for it given both its applications and implications.
  When high-level sales or usage metrics change, it’s often a key element in helping
  teams find the root cause.</p>

  <a href="#Productivity-vs-dilution" class="headerlink" title="Productivity vs. dilution"></a>Productivity vs. dilution</h2>
<p>In theory, startup options can make sense for employees given the risk / reward tradeoffs,
  but the choice is much less simple when accounting for structural elements in option
  grant fine print. For example, employees typically have 90 or less days to exercise
  vested shares when they leave the company. This can represent a huge cost for most
  employees in exchange for no immediate cash gain (unless the startup happens to
  be in the process of completing a liquidity event). </p>
<p>Some companies have begun to opt into providing significantly longer post-termination
  exercise periods, but this has implications as well for employees who chose not
  to leave the company (and future employees), in the form of a gradually increasing
  dilution of the equity pool.</p>
<p>In an environment where more companies are opting to forego exiting (given ease of
  raising private money, being profitable but unwilling to deal with public markets,
  or a host of other reasons), decisions around the structure of an option plan can
  have big implications. Either unengaged / unqualified employees choose to stick
  around for a long time if the plan is too strict, or they create a massive dilutive
  liability if the plan is too lax.</p>
<h2 id="Focus-vs-Education">
  <a href="#Focus-vs-Education" class="headerlink" title="Focus vs. Education"></a>Focus vs. Education</h2>
<p>Most startups won’t be profitable at the time an option plan is devised, meaning
  the founders / executives have bigger fish to fry than to build a complex customizabe
  option plan that works for every employee. Building a business, hiring, finding
  a market, and creating a great product represent work that already takes a great
  deal of time and sacrifice, so even with the best intentions in mind, founders
  are unlikely to focus on this problem.</p>
<p>Many startup employees don’t know enough about equity compensation (especially stock
  options) to ask for the provisions which would best fit their individual situation,
  or to prepare for a given outcome (such as how to pay for vested shares when exiting
  the company). Perversely, there is a disincentive for founders to help educate
  employees, as this could reduce the company’s future optionality in the form of
  fundraising, future hires, the founders’ own compensation, etc. Even if employees
  were educated on these things, it’s unlikely that the company would customize the
  offer for any but the most senior employees. </p>
<p>So there isn’t time to build the perfectly complex plan, and there isn’t enough education
  to ensure employees make the best decisions for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="Outsourced-management">
  <a href="#Outsourced-management" class="headerlink" title="Outsourced management"></a>Outsourced management</h2>
<p>With a few inputs from a startup’s management, would it be possible for an outsourced
  manager to create more custom plans for employees?</p>
<p>From the employer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Share of equity pool allocated to ESOP</li>
  <li>General comp bands by position</li>
  <li>Value of current common shares</li>
  <li>Known cash risks for the business</li>
  <li>Liquidity event likelihood</li>
  <li>Employee base and hiring rate</li>
</ul>
<p>From the employee:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Known and expected personal liquidity risks</li>
  <li>Financial risk tolerance</li>
  <li>Employment lifestage and flight risk</li>
  <li>Business’ performance expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time could the outsourced manager scalably educate employees and manage custom
  option plans, from offer through to exercise (including during employee termination)?
  </p>
<p>Could more commodity management and financial products be offered to employees over
  time as the outsourced manager scaled?</p>

<p>Ego is a mofo…</p>
<h1 id="‘What-Really-Goes-On’">
  <a href="#‘What-Really-Goes-On’" class="headerlink" title="‘What Really Goes On’"></a>‘What Really Goes On’</h1>
<p>One of my favorite Phife Dog rhymes is “Ego/I’m on my own jock skill/Cuz if I don’t
  say I’m the best/Tell me who the hell will”. </p>
<p>Founding teams are filled with egos. You probably already know that. Because you’re
  fucking awesome and know everything about everything. We all do. Ego is why an
  entrepreneur thinks their idea is a winner. Ego is why an entrepreneur runs through
  walls when others give up. Ego is why an entrepreneur risks it for the biscuit.
  </p>
<p>(You already know where I’m going with this)</p>
<p>Ego is also a huge source of conflict. Building anything requires communication and
  compromise. Ego prevents both.</p>
<p>If I’m right and you say the same thing as me, but you get the credit, what’s my
  reaction? Ego says “f- that guy!”. Ego strength, on the other hand, says “I’m happy
  someone I respect agrees. I must be on the right path.”</p>
<p>If I have an idea of how to reach a goal, and you have a different idea of how to
  reach a goal, what’s my reaction? Ego says “f- that guy!”. Ego strength says “I
  respect your process, and since you’re leading the effort, I trust you.”</p>
<h1 id="‘Keep-It-Movin’">
  <a href="#‘Keep-It-Movin’" class="headerlink" title="‘Keep It Movin’"></a>‘Keep It Movin’</h1>
<p>Our product leads are hyper talented. They know the subject matter, they know the
  technology, and they have a clear vision of where we need to be. I trust them explicitly
  to get us where we need to be. That’s why they own product.</p>
<p>Last week, ego and ego strength collided. During a discussion about our product with
  the product team, I wasn’t happy with the speed with which we were progressing.
  As a CSPO and terrible amateur product manager, I had envisioned a very specific
  process. This was not the process the product team was using in this specific conversation,
  and I didn’t think that was right. </p>
<p>Ego reared its infinitely ugly head, and I lashed out. I wanted them to follow my
  process, the scrum product owner process, moving forward. “We will not build our
  product on a shitty foundation. How the hell are we going to attract the engineering
  talent we need without properly written epics? It’s critical that we use my process,
  the approved process, the common process, the correct process from the beginning.”</p>
<p>Instead of reacting to my idiocy, one of our product leads stopped my rant and explained
  what he was actually doing. He walked me through his approach, and assured me that
  the deliverables would be what I expected. By simply acknowledging my concerns
  and explaining his approach, he mitigated my anxiety and reinforced his competency.
  </p>
<p>Ego strength won. </p>
<p>Matt</p>

  <li>I swear no more Tribe references (for now).</li>
  <li>Company and product will be revealed soon. Patience is a virtue.</li>

  <br>// The ability to find and prioritize low-effort-high-impact work diminishes as
  organizations mature. Many organizations tend to shift into prioritizing low-effort-low-impact
  work as a result, which rarely creates long-term value. Focus on high-effort-high-impact
  work, since this is where the value lies.</p>

  of other things that the Apple / Siri team has to consider. As a result, they’ve
  produced a great always-on, high responsive product with a great user experience.</p>

  <br>// Couple notable quotes:
  <br>‘As with most such things, culture is one of a company’s most powerful assets right
  until it isn’t: the same underlying assumptions that permit an organization to
  scale massively constrain the ability of that same organization to change direction.
  More distressingly, culture prevents organizations from even knowing they need
  to do so.’ ‘Leadership is now the ability to step outside the culture that created
  the leader and to start evolutionary change processes that are more adaptive. This
  ability to perceive the limitations of one’s own culture and to evolve the culture
  adaptively is the essence and ultimate challenge of leadership.’</p>

<p>SO, I’m founding a start-up. Well, technically I’m founding a start-up with a team
  of talented contributors. We’re going to conquer the world by using [technology]
  to deliver [adjective] outcomes for [customer segment] in [industry]. It’s going
  to be amazing!</p>

  <a href="#‘Intro-The-First-Step-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Intro (The First Step)’"></a>‘Intro (The First Step)’</h1>
<p>You know what’s awesome about start-ups? Everyone genuinely wants to get involved
  with your company in some way, and everyone has an opinion on how to build it.
  “Focus on these customers.” “Don’t forget to do X,Y,Z.” “Beware of these pitfalls.”
  Etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, though: All of that guidance and opinions and parables and bullshit
  out there starts once you’ve actually founded the company. You can find resources
  on product development, finding customers, raising money, blah, blah, blah. Very
  few people talk about how to get to the starting line. The “holy shit, we’re going
  to start a real company with real responsibilities!” starting line.</p>
<p>Where are the mentors who want to help you incorporate? Who want to help you pick
  your founders? Who want to help you build your board, without requiring a seat?
  Who love employer ID numbers, and taxes, and choosing the correct fucking insurance?
  No one eagerly steps up to help with the hard, boring, unsexy, soul-crushing, yet
  absolutely critical, decisions required to get started. Unless they want a piece
  of the company.</p>
<p>How many companies fail at this stage? Is this the plight of the COO? What challenges
  are next? Does any of it really matter?</p>

  believe’). I really, truly, believe that (see previous sentence). Can our team
  win? Let’s find out…</p>

  <li>I know how to use Google. Please do not send me anything from the first 2 pages

    a more appropriate time when I’m ready to digest your guidance fully. I promise
    you’ll have that opportunity.</li>
  <li>I’ll reveal our product soon.</li>

<p>Currently, whistleblowers can rely on platforms which use anonymising networks to
  allow submission of sensitive information (the leaked content cannot easily be
  traced back to the content provider). In order to use the network, the whistleblower
  needs to download software (i.e. browser) and access services, so some basic technical
  skill is required, and UX is not well-evolved.</p>
<p>UX issues aside, once the information has been submitted, it needs to be distributed.

<p>Although there are options for whistleblowers, do similar widely-used options exist
  for anonymous submission and distribution of ‘less serious’ content? For example
  an anonymous content platform for news, rumors, anonymous memoirs, etc.?</p>
<p>Since these ‘less serious’ users may intend to produce content with the purpose of
  receiving payment, could payment mechanisms be created such that these users could
  be paid immediately and near-anonymously based on pre-existing terms (i.e. number
  of views, clicks, etc.)?</p>
<p>Could a better user experience be created for the providers, which allows for management
  of submission, distribution, and incoming payments?</p>

  <br>// Hypothesis is that Google is the rare company that succeeded (immensely) almost
  purely from having superior technology, rather than business development, operational
  execution, marketing, product strategy, etc. Moving forward, this may present challenges
  to the company’s ability to compete with superior businesses, in spite of better
  tech.</p>

  <br>// Mongol hordes, which innovated upon war through the integration of cavalry,
  may have retreated from central Europe primarily because of a swamp-like environment

  horses in Hungary, much of the disruptive advantage they had come to rely upon
  disappeared. Not dissimilar to Napoleon’s army in wintertime Russia.</p>

<p>Litigation may be fairly easy in modern times (especially for people with the funds

  </p>
<p>Class action lawsuits tend to make it significantly easier for people to sue businesses
  for similar or shared greivances. Upfront costs are reduced, plaintiffs can be
  represented without being directly involved in the suit, and legal representation
  can be consolidated across plaintiffs. That being said, there are still challenges
  in these types of suits. They need to be certified by a judge, the suits require
  named plaintiffs to step up and start the suit, it’s difficult to select the best
  legal representation, lawyers are incentivized to settle, and so on.</p>

<p>Early stage employees (usually among 1st 40 hires, or joined before the company is
  unit positive) tend to take on significant time and salary risk when joining startups.</p>
<p>Some of this risk is compensated for by the opportunity to grow and generate impact
  at rates that these employees wouldn’t have been able to achieve in more mature
  businesses. Some of it is through the building of strong relationships forged through
  fire drills, all-nighters, and solving impossible problems. And lastly, some of
  it is compensated by vested equity.</p>
<p>Much of the value from the first couple of aforementioned trade-offs are dependent
  on the employees’ own effort and focus. For the third, the equity, a lot is out
  of the their control, especially when it comes to fundraising.</p>
<h2 id="Impact-of-raising-capital">
  <a href="#Impact-of-raising-capital" class="headerlink" title="Impact of raising capital"></a>Impact of raising capital</h2>
<p>When companies choose to take on funding, they do so for a variety of reasons (staying
  afloat, working capital, new opportunities, fundraising climate, etc.), but they
  rarely consult or involve employees other than executives. </p>
<p>Yet the impacts of raising more money can have significant impact on one of the major
  reasons that employee give up time, salary, and oftentimes mental well-being to
  work at the company.</p>
<p>General dilution, preference, protection, increased cash burn, etc. are all ways
  that an employee’s equity stake can be significantly impacted. Aside from dilution,
  employees tend to be very inexperienced with most of the other ways that raising
  money can impact their common equity value.</p>

<p>Could the insurance provider price the offering well enough to both mimize counterparty
  risk and benefit employees?</p>
<p>Is it possible that breakage (from unclaimed insurance or canceled policies) could
  effectively stand in for a counterparty?</p>

    is exactly what Twitter required. You had to know what you were interested in,
    know who to follow based on those interests, and then, to top it all off, you

    readers from signing up for e-mail newsletters. Bezos calls ideas that could
    upset Post subscribers, like jamming too many ads on a Web page, “reader hostile.”’</li>
  <li>‘Bezos requires Post executives to write lengthy memos outlining their projects
    instead of using PowerPoint presentations, believing that narrative writing forces
    people to think more deeply’</li>
  <li>‘Inside the new newsroom in Washington […] a large screen displays real-time traffic
    statistics of stories on its website. […] Bezos suggested measuring whether readers
    prefer the Post to its rivals. So engineers created a program that takes articles
    from [competitors], strips out their branding, then surveys readers on which
    articles they’d rather read’</li>

<ul>
  <li>Each of the FANG companies was technically innovative in their own way […] but
    each of them […]depended to an incredible degree on products and infrastructure
    that already existed</li>
  <li>‘By owning the consumer entry point — the primary choke point — […] the FANG companies
    have been able to modularize and commoditize their suppliers’</li>
  <li>‘they are “aggregators” who start with the best customers and don’t really compete
    with incumbent companies, at least in the beginning. In fact, incumbents nearly
    universally benefit from the presence of aggregators, at least at first’</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/01/nobody-wants-use-your-product/" target="_blank" rel="external">Nobody Wants To Use Your Product</a> by Goran Peuc</p>
<ul>
  <li>‘People are not really into using products. Any time spent by a user operating
    an interface, twisting knobs, pulling levers or tapping buttons is time wasted.
    Rather, people are more interested in the end result and in obtaining that result
    in the quickest, least intrusive and most efficient manner possible’</li>
  <li>‘When you think about it, do you really want to work on heating up your food, or
    do you just want your food to be hot? This is why microwave ovens can be found
    in basically every modern kitchen; it removes as much work as possible from the
    process of heating food. Of course, quite a lot of manufacturers still do not
    realize this and make their microwave ovens overly complicated with too many
    buttons and settings.’</li>
  <li>‘This difference in approach — building for features versus building for result — can
    be seen in numerous products today, both digital and physical. The main reason
    why some products are great is that they take the load off of users and assist
    them in making decisions.’</li>
  <li>Lots of great examples: Nest, Dropbox, Google search, Gov.uk, Amazon Dash, Apple
    updates vs. Adobe Flash updates, etc.</li>

<ul>
  <li>IBM’s modern-day roots began as a function of refocusing. This cultural trait served
    IBM well when facing more innovative competition, by relying on superior execution.
    100 years later today, IBM is a longtime regular on S&amp;P 500, in an age where
    the avg S&amp;P lifespan is 10 years.</li>
  <li>Mission drives strategy - ‘The truth is that your mission needs to drive your strategy,
    not the other way around. Genuine excellence requires passion, commitment and
    consistency. You can’t create that in a boardroom meeting or a strategy session.
    It takes focus over an extended period of time.’</li>
  <li>‘To be a great performer — in any field — you simply have to do things better.
    That takes work. You need continually up your game over a period of years — or
    even decades — in order to get it right. That takes focus.’</li>

    DNA</a> by Amy Gesenhues</p>
<ul>
  <li>‘Amazon makes the customer its top priority, aiming to create an experience so
    magical “… it disappears into our customer’s every day as their new normal.”’</li>
  <li>Article stated takeaways: ‘Treat the customer as an individual, not a segment.
    Invest in earning trust, and never take it for granted. Think about making magic,
    more than making money.’</li>
  <li>‘We always work backwards from the experience we believe an individual customer
    might appreciate, before we develop anything.’</li>
  <li>‘I don’t formally “lead” the customer experience efforts, except in the same way
    as everyone in the company leads customer experience — it’s part of everyone’s
    job, every day.’</li>

  <li>This article is about SAAS companies, but some good transferables.</li>
  <li>Onboarded should be defined by the customer, not the business.</li>
  <li>Know when the first value has been delivered, and drive the next level of engagement
    from that point.</li>
  <li>Talk to users to understand both of the above</li>

<ul>
  <li>This one is worth reading multiple times.</li>
  <li>Small, understaffed companies have the opportunity to ruthlessly prioritize ‘the
    most important thing’. Don’t waste this opportunity.</li>
  <li>All companies face the challenge of losing focus. When the entire company is working
    on fewer things, synergy effects result in big productivity gains.</li>
  <li>Leaders at every level over-index on their influence on the company’s culture.
    If it’s not working the way you want, look inward.</li>
  <li>Make your product dead simple. The easier it is to learn, the easier it is to engage.
    The easier it is to engage, the easier it is to find value.</li>
  <li>Power users are a great collective PM. Utilize them.</li>

<p>Reflecting upon the demise of a promising goal-accomplishment platform.</p>
<p>Positives = great design, sales pitch, and investors</p>
<p>Not so positive =</p>
<ul>
  <li>Too many features outside of the core offering</li>
  <li>Site speed and tech debt matter…to a degree. Blaming the cofounder is a bit disingenuous,
    but what follows makes sense. Don’t overbet on big features that you haven’t
    tested for user interest (and that may be outside your core offering). Also,
    unit testing is really important (as is, one could argue, dogfooding).</li>
  <li>Didn’t pick and effectively track core metrics</li>
  <li>Cash burn</li>
  <li>Didn’t build a strong user feedback mechanism. Comments around not cracking motivation,
    etc, belie a lack of obsessive customer focus. Great comments later on regarding
    making it easy first, then fast, and then pretty.</li>

<ul>
  <li>“Judge a company’s priorities by it’s pixels” can also be pointed inwards. Judge
    your own company’s priorities by its pixels. Make your company’s pixels reflect
    it’s priorities.</li>
  <li>“Professional assassins don’t introduce themselves” — It makes sense to test and
    iterate on relatively small % of your population, so well-positioned competitors
    don’t jump into the fray before you’ve worked through the kinks. Easier to do
    for a small startup than a Facebook of course.</li>

  <li>User empathy and UX focus produce compound returns over time. Many companies state
    that they focus on these things, but metrics and budgets state otherwise.</li>
  <li>Understanding the ‘why’ behind customer activity is meaningfully more important
    than the ‘what’</li>
  <li>Move fast and iterate. “Consider Instagram, which launched by rolling out a product,
    learning which features were most popular (image sharing, commenting, and liking),
    and then relaunching a stripped-down version.”</li>

  by Sarah Halzack</p>
<ul>
  <li>Retail product sales were weak over the holiday season; however air travel and
    restaurant sales were relatively strong. Hypothesis is that this represents a
    millenial-driven mix shift in preferences towards experiences over materials.</li>
  <li>Physical retailers are experimenting with incorporating more engaging interactions
    into the shopping experience. Nordstrom allows users to design their own shoes.
    Lululemon enabling exercise. Urban Outfitters and Pizza?</li>

  <li>Lots of good lessons in here, but the biggest takeaway is that there are a lot
    of ways that things can go wrong, and a lot of luck involved.</li>
