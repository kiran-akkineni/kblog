  <a href="#Adverse-selection-vs-dead-equity" class="headerlink" title="Adverse selection vs. dead equity"></a>Adverse selection vs. dead equity</h2>
<p>In theory, startup options can make sense for employees given the risk / reward tradeoffs,
  but the choice is much less simple when accounting for structural elements in option
  grant fine print. For example, employees typically have 90 or less days to exercise
  vested shares when they leave the company. This can represent a huge cost for most
  employees in exchange for no immediate cash gain (unless the startup happens to
  be in the process of completing a liquidity event). </p>
<p>Some companies have begun to opt into providing significantly longer post-termination
  exercise periods, but this has implications as well for employees who chose not
  to leave the company (and future employees), in the form of a gradually increasing
  dilution of the equity pool.</p>
<p>In an environment where more companies are opting to forego exiting (given ease of
  raising private money, being profitable but unwilling to deal with public markets,
  or a host of other reasons), decisions around the structure of an option plan can
  have big implications. Either unengaged / unqualified employees choose to stick
  around for a long time if the plan is too strict, or they create a massive dilutive
  liability if the plan is too lax.</p>
<h2 id="Focus-vs-Education">
  <a href="#Focus-vs-Education" class="headerlink" title="Focus vs. Education"></a>Focus vs. Education</h2>
<p>Most startups won’t be profitable at the time an option plan is devised, meaning
  the founders / executives have bigger fish to fry than to build a complex customizabe
  option plan that works for every employee. Building a business, hiring, finding
  a market, and creating a great product represent work that already takes a great
  deal of time and sacrifice, so even with the best intentions in mind, founders
  are unlikely to focus on this problem.</p>
<p>Many startup employees don’t know enough about equity compensation (especially stock
  options) to ask for the provisions which would best fit their individual situation,
  or to prepare for a given outcome (such as how to pay for vested shares when exiting
  the company). Perversely, there is a disincentive for founders to help educate
  employees, as this could reduce the company’s future optionality in the form of
  fundraising, future hires, the founders’ own compensation, etc. Even if employees
  were educated on these things, it’s unlikely that the company would customize the
  offer for any but the most senior employees. </p>
<p>So there isn’t time to build the perfectly complex plan, and there isn’t enough education
  to ensure employees make the best decisions for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="Outsourced-management">
  <a href="#Outsourced-management" class="headerlink" title="Outsourced management"></a>Outsourced management</h2>
<p>With a few inputs from a startup’s management, would it be possible for an outsourced
  manager to create more custom plans for employees?</p>
<p>From the employer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Share of equity pool allocated to ESOP</li>
  <li>General comp bands by position</li>
  <li>Value of current common shares</li>
  <li>Known cash risks for the business</li>
  <li>Liquidity event likelihood</li>
  <li>Employee base and hiring rate</li>
</ul>
<p>From the employee:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existing liquidity risks (current savings, debt, etc.)</li>
  <li>Financial risk tolerance</li>
  <li>Employment lifestage and flight risk</li>
  <li>Expectations around the business</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time could the outsourced manager scalably educate employees and manage custom
  option plans, from offer through to exercise (including during employee termination)?
  </p>
<p>Could more commodity management and financial products be offered to employees over

<p>Ego is a mofo…</p>
<h1 id="‘What-Really-Goes-On’">
  <a href="#‘What-Really-Goes-On’" class="headerlink" title="‘What Really Goes On’"></a>‘What Really Goes On’</h1>
<p>One of my favorite Phife Dog rhymes is “Ego/I’m on my own jock skill/Cuz if I don’t
  say I’m the best/Tell me who the hell will”. </p>
<p>Founding teams are filled with egos. You probably already know that. Because you’re
  fucking awesome and know everything about everything. We all do. Ego is why an
  entrepreneur thinks their idea is a winner. Ego is why an entrepreneur runs through
  walls when others give up. Ego is why an entrepreneur risks it for the biscuit.
  </p>
<p>(You already know where I’m going with this)</p>
<p>Ego is also a huge source of conflict. Building anything requires communication and
  compromise. Ego prevents both.</p>
<p>If I’m right and you say the same thing as me, but you get the credit, what’s my
  reaction? Ego says “f- that guy!”. Ego strength, on the other hand, says “I’m happy
  someone I respect agrees. I must be on the right path.”</p>
<p>If I have an idea of how to reach a goal, and you have a different idea of how to
  reach a goal, what’s my reaction? Ego says “f- that guy!”. Ego strength says “I
  respect your process, and since you’re leading the effort, I trust you.”</p>
<h1 id="‘Keep-It-Movin’">
  <a href="#‘Keep-It-Movin’" class="headerlink" title="‘Keep It Movin’"></a>‘Keep It Movin’</h1>
<p>Our product leads are hyper talented. They know the subject matter, they know the
  technology, and they have a clear vision of where we need to be. I trust them explicitly
  to get us where we need to be. That’s why they own product.</p>
<p>Last week, ego and ego strength collided. During a discussion about our product with
  the product team, I wasn’t happy with the speed with which we were progressing.
  As a CSPO and terrible amateur product manager, I had envisioned a very specific
  process. This was not the process the product team was using in this specific conversation,
  and I didn’t think that was right. </p>
<p>Ego reared its infinitely ugly head, and I lashed out. I wanted them to follow my
  process, the scrum product owner process, moving forward. “We will not build our
  product on a shitty foundation. How the hell are we going to attract the engineering
  talent we need without properly written epics? It’s critical that we use my process,
  the approved process, the common process, the correct process from the beginning.”</p>
<p>Instead of reacting to my idiocy, one of our product leads stopped my rant and explained
  what he was actually doing. He walked me through his approach, and assured me that
  the deliverables would be what I expected. By simply acknowledging my concerns
  and explaining his approach, he mitigated my anxiety and reinforced his competency.
  </p>
<p>Ego strength won. </p>
<p>Matt</p>

  <li>I swear no more Tribe references (for now).</li>
  <li>Company and product will be revealed soon. Patience is a virtue.</li>

  <br>// The ability to find and prioritize low-effort-high-impact work diminishes as
  organizations mature. Many organizations tend to shift into prioritizing low-effort-low-impact
  work as a result, which rarely creates long-term value. Focus on high-effort-high-impact
  work, since this is where the value lies.</p>

  <br>// The Echo team is completely focused on building a great voice-only in-home assistant,
  allowing them not to have to worry about or prioritize mobility, UI, or a slew
  of other things that the Apple / Siri team has to consider. As a result, they’ve
  produced a great always-on, high responsive product with a great user experience.</p>

  <br>// Despite rampant growth and engagement, Spotify’s costs-to-serve may be too high

  <br>// Couple notable quotes:
  <br>‘As with most such things, culture is one of a company’s most powerful assets right
  until it isn’t: the same underlying assumptions that permit an organization to
  scale massively constrain the ability of that same organization to change direction.
  More distressingly, culture prevents organizations from even knowing they need
  to do so.’ ‘Leadership is now the ability to step outside the culture that created
  the leader and to start evolutionary change processes that are more adaptive. This
  ability to perceive the limitations of one’s own culture and to evolve the culture
  adaptively is the essence and ultimate challenge of leadership.’</p>

<p>SO, I’m founding a start-up. Well, technically I’m founding a start-up with a team
  of talented contributors. We’re going to conquer the world by using [technology]
  to deliver [adjective] outcomes for [customer segment] in [industry]. It’s going
  to be amazing!</p>

  <a href="#‘Intro-The-First-Step-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Intro (The First Step)’"></a>‘Intro (The First Step)’</h1>
<p>You know what’s awesome about start-ups? Everyone genuinely wants to get involved
  with your company in some way, and everyone has an opinion on how to build it.
  “Focus on these customers.” “Don’t forget to do X,Y,Z.” “Beware of these pitfalls.”
  Etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, though: All of that guidance and opinions and parables and bullshit
  out there starts once you’ve actually founded the company. You can find resources
  on product development, finding customers, raising money, blah, blah, blah. Very
  few people talk about how to get to the starting line. The “holy shit, we’re going
  to start a real company with real responsibilities!” starting line.</p>
<p>Where are the mentors who want to help you incorporate? Who want to help you pick
  your founders? Who want to help you build your board, without requiring a seat?
  Who love employer ID numbers, and taxes, and choosing the correct fucking insurance?
  No one eagerly steps up to help with the hard, boring, unsexy, soul-crushing, yet
  absolutely critical, decisions required to get started. Unless they want a piece
  of the company.</p>
<p>How many companies fail at this stage? Is this the plight of the COO? What challenges
  are next? Does any of it really matter?</p>

  believe’). I really, truly, believe that (see previous sentence). Can our team
  win? Let’s find out…</p>

  <li>I know how to use Google. Please do not send me anything from the first 2 pages

    a more appropriate time when I’m ready to digest your guidance fully. I promise
    you’ll have that opportunity.</li>
  <li>I’ll reveal our product soon.</li>

<p>Currently, whistleblowers can rely on platforms which use anonymising networks to
  allow submission of sensitive information (the leaked content cannot easily be
  traced back to the content provider). In order to use the network, the whistleblower
  needs to download software (i.e. browser) and access services, so some basic technical
  skill is required, and UX is not well-evolved.</p>
<p>UX issues aside, once the information has been submitted, it needs to be distributed.

<p>Although there are options for whistleblowers, do similar widely-used options exist

  an anonymous content platform for news, rumors, anonymous memoirs, etc.?</p>
<p>Since these ‘less serious’ users may intend to produce content with the purpose of
  receiving payment, could payment mechanisms be created such that these users could
  be paid immediately and near-anonymously based on pre-existing terms (i.e. number

<p>Could a better user experience be created for the providers, which allows for management
  of submission, distribution, and incoming payments?</p>

  <br>// Hypothesis is that Google is the rare company that succeeded (immensely) almost
  purely from having superior technology, rather than business development, operational
  execution, marketing, product strategy, etc. Moving forward, this may present challenges
  to the company’s ability to compete with superior businesses, in spite of better
  tech.</p>

<p>Litigation may be fairly easy in modern times (especially for people with the funds

<p>Class action lawsuits tend to make it significantly easier for people to sue businesses
  for similar or shared greivances. Upfront costs are reduced, plaintiffs can be
  represented without being directly involved in the suit, and legal representation
  can be consolidated across plaintiffs. That being said, there are still challenges
  in these types of suits. They need to be certified by a judge, the suits require
  named plaintiffs to step up and start the suit, it’s difficult to select the best
  legal representation, lawyers are incentivized to settle, and so on.</p>

<p>Early stage employees (usually among 1st 40 hires, or joined before the company is
  unit positive) tend to take on significant time and salary risk when joining startups.</p>
<p>Some of this risk is compensated for by the opportunity to grow and generate impact
  at rates that these employees wouldn’t have been able to achieve in more mature
  businesses. Some of it is through the building of strong relationships forged through
  fire drills, all-nighters, and solving impossible problems. And lastly, some of
  it is compensated by vested equity.</p>
<p>Much of the value from the first couple of aforementioned trade-offs are dependent
  on the employees’ own effort and focus. For the third, the equity, a lot is out
  of the their control, especially when it comes to fundraising.</p>
<h2 id="Impact-of-raising-capital">
  <a href="#Impact-of-raising-capital" class="headerlink" title="Impact of raising capital"></a>Impact of raising capital</h2>
<p>When companies choose to take on funding, they do so for a variety of reasons (staying
  afloat, working capital, new opportunities, fundraising climate, etc.), but they
  rarely consult or involve employees other than executives. </p>
<p>Yet the impacts of raising more money can have significant impact on one of the major
  reasons that employee give up time, salary, and oftentimes mental well-being to
  work at the company.</p>
<p>General dilution, preference, protection, increased cash burn, etc. are all ways
  that an employee’s equity stake can be significantly impacted. Aside from dilution,
  employees tend to be very inexperienced with most of the other ways that raising
  money can impact their common equity value.</p>

<p>Could the insurance provider price the offering well enough to both mimize counterparty
  risk and benefit employees?</p>
<p>Is it possible that breakage (from unclaimed insurance or canceled policies) could

  Smith</p>
<ul>
  <li>‘They talk about reducing “cognitive overhead” and “friction” that discourages
    readers from signing up for e-mail newsletters. Bezos calls ideas that could
    upset Post subscribers, like jamming too many ads on a Web page, “reader hostile.”’</li>
  <li>‘Bezos requires Post executives to write lengthy memos outlining their projects
    instead of using PowerPoint presentations, believing that narrative writing forces
    people to think more deeply’</li>
  <li>‘Inside the new newsroom in Washington […] a large screen displays real-time traffic
    statistics of stories on its website. […] Bezos suggested measuring whether readers
    prefer the Post to its rivals. So engineers created a program that takes articles
    from [competitors], strips out their branding, then surveys readers on which
    articles they’d rather read’</li>
