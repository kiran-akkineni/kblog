    <p>Kiran has that special superpower of bringing both data and sanity to decision
      making. One of the sharpest minds I have worked with, he is usually the first
      to cut through the noise to what matters and has the gravitas to push it forward.
      But, if you want to really see him shine, give him a mic and ask him to talk
      about culture. He cares as much about the people and the how as the metrics
      and the what.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When I think about my career there are certain people who jump off the page as
      those who “get it”. Kiran is one of those people. He has the unique combination
      of a super-power (analytics), experience, and the ability to think clearly
      in the most hectic of times. During my time working with Kiran at Porch I was
      consistently reminded of how well the values of a company can compliment an
      organization when you hire individuals who are manifestation of those values.
      Kiran, in particular, was the embodiment of many values that serve as the glue
      for great teams and companies. He is a world-class problem solver, someone
      who truly understands the impact of data and analytics when it comes to clear
      decision making, and a person who is a testament for the impact collaboration
      can have when it comes to creating a great leadership team. Kiran is a straight
      shooter who tears down walls and prevents silo’d thinking from creeping into
      an organization. If I were to start a business tomorrow and I needed to draft
