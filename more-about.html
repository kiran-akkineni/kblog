<p>Porch:</p>
<p>Matthew Neagle - “Kiran has that special superpower of bringing both data and sanity
  to decision making. One of the sharpest minds I have worked with, he is usually
  the first to cut through the noise to what matters and has the gravitas to push
  it forward. But, if you want to really see him shine, give him a mic and ask him
  to talk about culture. He cares as much about the people and the how as the metrics
  and the what.”</p>
<p>Craig Cincotta - “When I think about my career there are certain people who jump
  off the page as those who “get it”. Kiran is one of those people. He has the unique
  combination of a super-power (analytics), experience, and the ability to think
  clearly in the most hectic of times. During my time working with Kiran at Porch
  I was consistently reminded of how well the values of a company can compliment
  an organization when you hire individuals who are manifestation of those values.
  Kiran, in particular, was the embodiment of many values that serve as the glue
  for great teams and companies. He is a world-class problem solver, someone who
  truly understands the impact of data and analytics when it comes to clear decision
  making, and a person who is a testament for the impact collaboration can have when
  it comes to creating a great leadership team. Kiran is a straight shooter who tears
  down walls and prevents silo’d thinking from creeping into an organization. If
  I were to start a business tomorrow and I needed to draft a set of players to create
  a “Dream Team”, Kiran would be on of the first people I would pick.”</p>
<p>Tom Ly - “Kiran is one of the most impressive individuals I have ever come across
  in my career. He is incredibly smart, driven, and of course, analytical. Despite
  all of that, what I love most about Kiran is his unwavering commitment to helping
  others. Since I’ve known Kiran, he has been an incredible mentor to me. He offers
  unique, honest, and really thoughtful advice about anything business or personal
  related. He is never hesitant to spend time with someone, often times going out
  of his way to put the needs of others before himself. I’m very thankful for having
  learned so much from Kiran.”</p>
<p>Joanna Lord - “Working with Kiran has been a career highlight for me. His passion
  is evident in everything he does and it pushes the organization around him to be
  better every day. His analytics methodology is one of the most evolved I’ve come
  across and I personally learned so much from working beside him. Whether he is
  building products, leading teams, or creating a data foundation for the company
  - Kiran’s dedication to doing things excellently is inspiring. I will miss working
  with him and only hope I get the chance to do it again someday.”</p>
<p>Danny Brown - “Kiran proved to be an excellent manager and mentor to me during his
  time at Porch. His analytical insights and thoughtful ability to articulate complex
  topics made it easy and enjoyable to work with him. He consistently pushes both
  the business and his direct reports to innovate and tackle meaningful, challenging
  problems. I would highly recommend Kiran as both a business leader and mentor.”</p>
<p>Asha Sharma - “I worked with Kiran for the past two years. He instilled an unforgettable
  and core rigor into our culture while building our analytics platform from the
  ground up. His demonstrated capabilities including his intellectual horsepower,
  operational execution, and distinct leadership afforded him opportunities to take
  on new challenges, solving instrumental problems across the business including
  in operations, marketing, fundraising and most recently product. He’s one of the
  clearest thinkers I know and perhaps most notably an inspiring leader. The team
  he hired is among some of the most talented individuals I’ve worked with in my
  career, and their respect for Kiran, judicious contributions to Porch and development
  is a direct reflection of Kiran’s leadership. I strongly recommend Kiran”</p>
<p>Alison Roberts - “Kiran is an impressive business leader, combining spot-on instinct
  with analytical know-how. He keenly focuses on data-driven strategy, and he inspires
  those around him to push for the same. His leadership creates more efficient and
  strategic business decisions, and he is highly respected at all levels of the organization.
  He has high expectations and continually challenged me to fight for the changes
  that I believed in. Kiran is an excellent mentor, and I’m thankful to have had
  the opportunity to work for him at Porch”</p>
<p>Matt Ehrlichman - “Kiran is an incredible individual and a great member of any team.
  He is entrepreneurial, hard-charging, has high expectations, moves fast, hires
  great people, and is analytical. Kiran has a long track record of building successful
  analytics organizations and I’d recommend him to other CEOs. In addition, Kiran
  is a good guy and is a great person to work with. Thumbs up here!”</p>
<p>Curren Mehta - “Kiran is one of the most intelligent and quantitative people I know.
  If you get a chance to speak to him, he will surely impress you with his vast knowledge
  of analytics and e-commerce growth. Furthermore, he has the rare ability to take
  complicated numerical results and insights and simplify them to be digestible by
  any listener. He pushes very hard for perfection, and he never asks people to do
  things that he would not ask of himself. In my opinion, this unwavering pursuit
  of perfection is one of the main reasons that Kiran is so successful. I learned
  a great deal, both technically and professionally, as a result of working for Kiran,
  and for this I am thankful.”</p>
<p>Alexandra Charnas - “It was really amazing to work with a manager like Kiran. He
  was hands off enough to provide me the learning opportunities and challenges I
  was looking for, but there for support and help when I needed it.
  <br>I reported to Kiran for a little under a year at Porch.com in his role as head
  of the analytics team. He was very thoughtful, approaching problem-solving in a
  logical and methodical way; he is able to think about and analyze an issue with
  a high level of clarity from multiple view points. Kiran is very talented and fun
  to work with. I will miss him!”</p>
<p>Timothy Ellis - “Kiran is smart, analytically-minded, and fair. He has the skills
  to look at many angles of a problem and apply creative, intelligent solutions.
  I really appreciated his straightforward style. No beating around the bush, just
  work together as a team to quality work done efficiently.
  <br>I would happily work with Kiran again in the future and strongly recommend him
  to anyone who asks.”</p>
<p>Zulily:</p>
<p>Justin Hayashi - “Kiran is a one-of-a-kind mind with a unique ability to blend the
  analytical with the creative to drive forward game-changing business strategies.
  He served as a mentor to many employees (myself included) and has an amazing ability
  to teach, explain, and instill. Kiran had an incredible impact on zulily’s trajectory,
  but perhaps even more impressive is that he was able to influence everyone around
  him to strive to do the same.”</p>
<p>Matt Francis - “I had the pleasure of working with Kiran for over almost 3 years
  at zulily. Kiran was always a great partner and collaborator with anything we worked
  on together. He has an excellent fundamental understanding of e-commerce and business
  in general and was always quick to ramp up on anything new. He is one of the rare
  individuals that I have run across in my career who “just gets it”. I would gladly
  jump at the change to work with him again.”</p>
<p>Doug Aley - “Kiran headed the analytics group when I was at zulily. Beyond being
  a stud of an analyst, Kiran is also an innovator, pushing the business to do more
  for customers and backing it up with data. The insights he and his team produced
  resulted in giant leaps forward in merchandising, product, operational processes,
  and measurement of the business. I’d work with him in a heartbeat if given the
  opportunity.”</p>
<p>Mike Errecart - “Kiran and I worked together for 2.5 years and collaborated closely
  on many projects. He is a very talented analyst and problem solver with an unsurpassed
  grasp of e-commerce marketing metrics. Plus the work ethic of a horse. If you need
  to get a handle on the numbers that drive your business, and you need someone to
  build the team, systems, and processes to make your analytics function great, then
  Kiran is your guy.”</p>
<p>Brendon McKeon - “Kiran is an exceptional analytics leader who can cut through complexity
  to focus in on the key actionable elements of a problem. His ability to quickly
  incorporate the details of an analysis into the big picture context creates momentum
  and drives projects forward. Kiran is also an excellent teacher, mentor, and team
  leader, and I enjoyed working with him at zulily.”</p>
<p>Sonia Nagala Chang - “Kiran is one of the most talented individuals with whom I’ve
  worked. His analytical skills, thought leadership, and intellectual curiosity are
  truly best in class, and I’ve learned a tremendous amount from him. He is an expert
  in e-commerce marketing and analytics, and a proven leader across the board. He
  will be greatly missed and I would jump at the opportunity to work with him again.”</p>
<p>Don Allen - “Kiran excels at translating high-level requirements into technical direction(s)
  and served as the linchpin of our efforts in developing the analytics platform
  for marketing. He is a professional who truly understands the many facets of a
  complicated ecosystem, from capturing data through answering critical business
  questions.”</p>
<p>Melissa Baird - “Kiran has that perfect balance of intelligence and curiosity that
  makes him a great analyst that can drive a business forward. He is always happy
  to help think through a problem and discuss conclusions and potential ramifications.
  With his gift for taking a complicated analysis and explaining it in an elegant,
  clear, straight-forward manner, the business is able to make confident directional
  decisions. I thoroughly enjoyed collaborating with him and would jump at the chance
  to work with him again in the future.”</p>
<p>Beth Lyons - “Kiran has outstanding skills in terms of marketing, analytics and communication.
  He and I partnered several times in the course of working together in zulily’s
  early years, and I would gladly work with him again. He has great cross-functional
  capabilities, goes the extra mile to understand the business, and then applies
  his acumen to accelerate its performance.
  <br>In his case, acumen goes well beyond just data and analytics. Kiran assesses the
  people, technology and data to create very powerful observations and key changes.
  In terms of zulily’s early years and pronounced growth from startup to major retailer,
  he has been quite influential.
  <br>For his ability, he is highly respected; for his personable and attentive demeanor,
  he is truly a valued colleague.”</p>
<p>Dimple Khurana - “I had the fortune of overlapping with Kiran at zulily for about
  a year. He has the unique ability to take really complex data &amp; simplifying
  it to drive business decisions, while also working with his team fully understand
  the intricacies &amp; nuances of the data. The analytics team he built at zulily
  was data-driven, adept, nimble, and provided great insights to moving the business
  forward. Kiran is a fun, honest, straight-forward, and effective manager and colleague.
  We miss him at zulily!”</p>
